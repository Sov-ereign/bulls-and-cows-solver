Bulls and Cows Solver

This project is a web-based solver for the classic "Bulls and Cows" game, where the objective is to guess a secret code based on feedback from each guess. The solver helps users efficiently guess the secret code by analyzing the bulls (correct digits in the correct position) and cows (correct digits in the wrong position). It provides features such as generating all possible combinations, calculating possible solutions based on user inputs, and suggesting the best next guess. The interface is clean, modern, and includes various social media links to connect with the project's creator.
